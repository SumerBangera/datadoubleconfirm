when they see my face And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be  I'll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way if I can be strong I know every mile would be worth my while When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong  Down an unknown road to embrace my fate Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you And a thousand years would be worth the wait It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through  And I won't look back, I can go the distance And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat It's an uphill slope But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance And my journey is complete, oh yeah  But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh  Like a shooting star, I will go the distance I will search the world, I will face its harms I don't care how far, I can go the distance 'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms  I will search the world, I will face its harms 'Till I

To be more precise, we can do text stemming (before removing punctuations or symbols). We will make use of a package called SnowballC. It will derive the root word for each term. An example is shown below."
